## 💡 Our Solution

**Foodified** is a hybrid platform that merges historical food safety data with **active consumer reports** to create **real-time trust scores** for food products and brands.

It features:
- **Power BI dashboards** to visualize trends, high-risk products, and regional severity
- A **user-friendly frontend** for consumers to report suspicious products
- A **gamified trust engine** that ranks brands and rewards honest reporting

🎯 We don't just visualize data — *we weaponize it for the people.*
